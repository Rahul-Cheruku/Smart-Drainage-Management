# Smart-Drainage-Management
Developed a NodeMCU-based device that detects water level and sends data using HTTP requests. Stored and displayed the current status of the water level.

Urbanization causes alteration of water runoff response in urbanizing the natural watersheds which, in turn increases possibility of storm water of flooding damages. The objective of this research is to clarify uncertainties and develop a readily implementable drainage and flood-control management program for the improvement of development-induced drainage impacts. It also involves the analysis to poor and unclean discharge of water in households because of how sensitive the runways of water could be. The failings of present systems and the inability to sustainably exploit surface and groundwater resources can be attributed essentially to poor planning, design, system management and development.

## What's our approach:
we are going to build a smart device that can sense when the drainage system gets blocked and if the water overflows because of this blockage, we will send a notification to the municipal authority for the necessary action. Moreover, using the Android application, the status of the drainage system can be monitored in real-time. This project is very similar to a normal water level indicator project that we have build earlier, but instead of water, we will be sensing sewage overflow and monitor it online using IoT. Here, two conductors were used as water level detectors which can also be replaced with float sensors in the similar fashion. I have soldered the circuit in a perf board as shown below
